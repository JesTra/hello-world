I am 56-years old, happily married and have three children (almost) out of the house
Two Yorkies, Max-the-Giant and Madam-Paris share our lives.
I love what I currently do and I enjoy reading and discovering new things.
I like to eat healthy and we are physically active and fit.
I am energised by interesting people and true professionals that have a meta-grasp of their world. I am equally energised by connecting to interesting people that knows the world and have a balanced and accommodating approach to things and people.
I beieve that we can solve any problem with an open mind and free creativity.
I am a seasoned professional in management and want to change MY world.
And I want to make visible to me the paralell world of coding/ programming that manages so much of our lives (and if I can, also get to understand AI much better).
